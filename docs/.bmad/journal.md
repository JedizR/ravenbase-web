## How to Write an Entry

Copy this template and fill in all fields. Never leave a field blank — use "None"
if genuinely nothing to report.

```
### STORY-XXX — [Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Sprint:** N | **Phase:** A or B | **Repo:** ravenbase-api or ravenbase-web
**Quality gate:** ✅ clean  OR  ⚠️ passed with warnings  OR  ❌ failed (describe fix)
**Commit:** `xxxxxxxx`  ← first 8 chars of git commit hash

**What was built:**
1–3 sentences. What exists now that did not exist before.

**Key decisions:**
Bullet points. Any non-obvious architectural choice made during this story and the
reason behind it. These are the entries most valuable to future agents and to you
when debugging months later. If you followed the story spec exactly with no
deviations, write "Implemented per spec — no deviations."

**Gotchas:**
Bullet points. Non-obvious behaviors, library quirks, environment surprises,
or things that took longer than expected. If none, write "None."

**Tech debt noted:**
Bullet points. Anything deferred, implemented suboptimally, or that should be
revisited in a later story. If none, write "None."
